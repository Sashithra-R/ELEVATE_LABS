1. Data Loading and Initial Checks
  -Loaded the dataset world_population.csv using pandas.
  -Used df.info(), df.describe(), df.isnull().sum(), and df.nunique() to understand data types, basic statistics, missing values, and unique counts.
  -No major missing values found; data types were appropriate.

2. Top Countries by World Population Percentage
  -Sorted countries by "World Population Percentage" (descending).
  -Observed top contributors like China, India, and USA.

3. Correlation Analysis
  -Selected only numeric columns using select_dtypes().
  -Created a correlation matrix and plotted a heatmap (sns.heatmap()).
  -High correlation between different year population columns.
  -Weak correlation between Area and Population.

4. Continent-Level Analysis
  -Grouped data by Continent and calculated the mean of population columns.
  -Sorted continents by "2022 Population".
  -Filtered data specifically for Oceania to observe its population characteristics.

5. Trend Analysis (1970-2022)
  -Created a new DataFrame (df1 and df2) with average population over decades by continent.
  -Plotted population growth trends across continents using a line plot.
  -Asia and Africa showed the highest growth.

6. Scatter Plot
  -Plotted a scatter plot between Continent and 2022 Population.
  -Highlighted the difference in population distribution across continents.

7. Boxplot
  -Plotted a boxplot (df.boxplot(figsize=(20,10))) to observe data spread and outliers across numeric columns.
  -Found extreme outliers like China and India for population.

8. Summary of Tools Used
  -Pandas: Data handling, aggregation, missing value check
  -Seaborn: Heatmap visualization
  -Matplotlib: Scatter plot, line plot, and boxplot visualization
